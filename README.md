#Introducing Flutter and Getting Started

In this chapter, "Introducing Flutter and Getting Started" I learned how the Flutter framework architecture works behind the scenes. I learned that Flutter is a great portable UI framework to build mobile applications for iOS and Android. Flutter also plans on supporting development for desktop, web, and embedded devices. Flutter applications are built from a single codebase that uses widgets to create the UI and that you develop with the Dart language. Flutter is an open-source, cross-platform mobile app development framework created by Google. It allows developers to build natively compiled applications for Android, iOS, web, desktop and embedded devices from a single codebase. Flutter's key features include the Dart programming language, widget-based architecture, rich libraries and APIs, customization options and fast performance. To get started, install the Flutter SDK, choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Android Studio or Visual Studio Code, and install the Dart plugin. Create a new project using the Flutter CLI or IDE templates, and run your first app using "flutter run" or the IDE's run button. Understanding widgets, state management, layouts, event handling and navigation are essential concepts. Additional resources include the official Flutter documentation, YouTube tutorials, online courses and developer communities.
